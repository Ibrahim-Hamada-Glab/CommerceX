## 2026-01-05 - Custom Dropdown Accessibility
**Learning:** Replacing div-based dropdown triggers with semantic <button> elements is the single most impactful accessibility win. Combining this with ARIA listbox roles and keyboard navigation (Enter/Space/Arrows) transforms an unusable component into an accessible one.
**Action:** Always check dropdown implementations for semantic HTML and keyboard support. Use the Combobox/Listbox pattern.
